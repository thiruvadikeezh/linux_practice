# linux_practice

## Overview

This repository, **linux_practice**, has been created solely for my personal use to learn, practice, and progressively get comfortable with the Linux operating system and its ecosystem. It serves as a structured workspace where I document my learning journey, experiments, and hands-on practice.

The primary objective of this repository is continuous learning through practical exposure rather than theoretical notes alone.

## Purpose

The key purposes of this repository are:

* To learn Linux fundamentals from the ground up
* To practice Linux commands, tools, and workflows
* To experiment with shell scripting and system utilities
* To track my progress and learning milestones over time
* To maintain a personal reference for commonly used commands and concepts

## What This Repository Contains

As my learning progresses, this repository may include:

* Command-line practice files
* Shell scripts
* Notes and summaries of Linux concepts
* Configuration experiments
* Small projects or automation tasks
* Logs of issues faced and how they were resolved

The structure and contents may evolve as my understanding of Linux improves.

## Learning Status & Progress

I will regularly update this section (or related files) to reflect:

* Current learning stage
* Topics covered
* Concepts in progress
* Future learning goals

This helps me stay accountable and provides a clear view of my growth over time.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for personal learning and experimentation. Practices, scripts, or configurations here may not follow production-level standards.

## Author

Maintained by me as part of my journey into learning Linux.
